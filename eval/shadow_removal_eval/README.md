 we conducted experiments on two settings for the ISTD dataset, following the methods used in DMTN and DHAN: 
 
(1) The results are evaluated at a resolution of $256\times 256$ after being resized. 

`evaluate_ISTD_results_256.m`
 
(2) The original image resolutions ($640\times 480$) are maintained for evaluation.
